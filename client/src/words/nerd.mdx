# Nerd

By 5 years old I was heavy into:
- [Super Mario Bros](https://arcadespot.com/game/super-mario-bros/) 
- [Tetris](https://arcadespot.com/game/classic-tetris/) 
- [Legend of Zelda](https://arcadespot.com/game/the-legend-of-zelda/) (not Second Quest though, so difficult!)

By 12 I was tinkering with:
- BASIC on an i386
- using warez for free software
- PokÃ©mon cartridge glitching
- recording primitive Zelda machinima on VHS

It only got worse ðŸ˜”

Once I had '[who I was](/trans)' figured out, it was a lot easier to imagine 'what I wanted to do' and my response was, "uh I don't know, nerd shit?"

I went from playing video games, where you pay to solve prescribed problems within software, to solving emergent problems using software. To my brain, they're the same thing -- solve the puzzle, get satisfaction. But because I'm creating value by solving novel problems instead of solved problems, I guess I can get a salary? Cool, nerd shit for a living.

I've created 'applications', but prefer making integrations, automation, and knitting existing things together in new and useful ways.
